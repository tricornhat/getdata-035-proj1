# getdata-035-proj1

The R script run_analysis.R loads data sample from a training session and a test
session in a trial of Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer data.

Two sessions of data, one training and one test, are merged and the standard deviation
and mean values are extracted. Data is organized by subject (test or training)
across six different activities.
